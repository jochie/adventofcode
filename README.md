# My solutions

I started participating in [2022](2022/), continued in
[2023](2023/).

Note: On Dec 9, 2023, I rewrote much of the repo history to remove the various `input` and `sample*` files, when I noticed a request to exclude those in the [About
page](https://adventofcode.com/about), which is why a **lot** of the commits are now from that day.

# Some sideshows

- A little bit of [Docker](docker/) help to run Linux tools in a macOS environment.
- Some [templates](templates/) (C, Perl, Python) that provide a framework for getting started on the next challenge.
