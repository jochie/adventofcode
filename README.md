# My solutions

I started participating in [2022](2022/), continued in [2023](2023/).

# Some sideshows

- A little bit of [Docker](docker/) help to run Linux tools in a macOS environment.
- Some [templates](templates/) (C, Perl, Python) that provide a framework for getting started on the next challenge.
